## Introduction:

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood cells characterized by recurrent, large-scale chromosomal abnormalities. Detection of these abnormalities is critical for proper treatment stratification(1, 2). The current standard of care involves testing of both cytogenetic and molecular markers, assessed through karyotyping and PCR-based tests, respectively. However, as new research identifies more clinically relevant markers, these serial tests are difficult to scale. Further, next-generation sequencing makes genome-wide testing possible, allowing for more complete testing and stratification.

The aim of this project is to infer large-scale chromosomal abnormalities in AML using RNA-seq data. RNA-seq is known to be a powerful technique for detection of SNVs, as well as AML-relevant fusion and internal tandem duplication events. 

However, detection of copy-number variants (CNVs) using RNA-seq data alone is quite challenging - copy-number gain or loss events are not reflected straightforwardly in observed RNA-seq read counts. Being able to provide accurate inference of large-scale chromosomal abnormalities from RNA-Seq data alone would be a significant advance in the field, and ultimately lead to better patient care.

## Methods:

We have re-analyzed data made available through a recent publication by The Cancer Genome Atlas (3). The data-set consists of raw count and RPKM measurements made from 179 patients with AML, with matched clinical data noting CNV events observed through standard cytogenetics.
