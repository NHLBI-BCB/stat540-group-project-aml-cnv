## Introduction:

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterized by recurrent, large-scale chromosomal abnormalities. Detection of these abnormalities is typically performed through karyotying or array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), both of which are technically limiting.

The aim of this project is to infer large-scale chromosomal abnormalities in AML using RNA-seq data. RNA-seq data provides an unbiased view of gene expression, and allows the detection of expressed structural variants that may be functionally relevant to the tumour phenotype.

The main rationale for using RNA-Seq is to increase the clinical utility of RNA-Seq based diagnostic testing in AML. For a clinical test to be useful in guiding AML treatment, the results need to be rapidly available. Furthermore, additional tests add to the time and expense of diagnosis. Being able to provide accurate inference of large-scale chromosomal abnormalities from RNA-Seq data alone would be a significant advance in the field, and ultimately lead to better patient care.
