=============================

Group project for STAT540, 2014 Edition. Detection of CNV events in Acute Myeloid Leukemia using RNA-Seq data

Project Description
-------------------

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterized by recurrent, large-scale chromosomal abnormalities.
Detection of these abnormalities is typically done through karyoptying, or through dedicated approaches like array-CGH.
This project will attempt to infer these events using RNA-Seq data. Since changes in gene expression linked to these large-scale chromosomal abnormalities are not expected to be simple, we will employ a range of approaches (TBD, but most likely including some sort of machine learning or clustering approaches) to predict these events.
