Import and Describe Count Data
==============================

At [issue #7](https://github.com/rdocking/stat540-group-project-aml-cnv/issues/7), Dr. Pavlidis suggested using the count data for the experiment rather than the normalized RPKM data.

My intent in this document is to download, import, and explore the read count data and try to figure out:

- How it was generated
- Whether any normalizations have been applied
- How we can use it for the differential expression experiments

Import Raw Data Files
---------------------

First, I'll import and compare the raw data files available at the [TCGA Data Portal Site](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/laml_2012/). These files have already been downloaded and stored in the repository in the `data` sub-directory:

```{r}
rpkm_dat <- read.table('../data/laml.rnaseq.179_v1.0_gaf2.0_rpkm_matrix.txt.tcgaID.txt.gz',
                       sep = "\t", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
count_dat <- read.table('../data/laml.rnaseq.179_v1.0_gaf2.0_read_count_matrix.txt.tcgaID.txt.gz',
                        sep = "\t", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
```
